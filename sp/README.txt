SPLib is a convenience library that provides some facilities commonly used 
across several of my own projects.  I have made it available in the hopes that
others will find it not only useful, but will extend it for their own purposes.

The major features of SPLib are: 

  * configuration files
  * a robust logging facility
  * a diagnostic framework
  * utility functions 
  
Future functionality will include:
  * database abstraction layer
  * support for plug-ins


So, this document addresses how to use the common features of SPLib.
